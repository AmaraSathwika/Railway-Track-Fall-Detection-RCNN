# 🚆 Railway Track Fall Detection System Using R-CNN for Infrastructure Safety

## 📌 Project Overview

Railway track failures such as **track falls, cracks, and obstacles** can cause severe accidents if not detected in time. This project presents an **AI-based railway track fall detection system** using **Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN)** to automatically identify defective track conditions from images.

The system detects faulty regions, highlights defects using **bounding boxes**, and triggers an **immediate alert message with siren sound** when a defect is identified. This approach enhances railway infrastructure safety and reduces reliance on manual inspection.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Detect railway track **falls, cracks, and obstacles**
* Automatically locate defective regions using bounding boxes
* Reduce dependency on manual railway inspections
* Provide **instant alert and warning messages**
* Improve railway infrastructure safety through early detection

## 🧠 Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **TensorFlow & Keras**
* **Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN / Faster R-CNN)**
* **Flask (Web Framework)**
* **OpenCV**
* **HTML, CSS**
* **LabelImg (for image annotation)**

## 📂 Dataset Description

The model is trained using an **image-based dataset** organized into two categories:

* **Defective** – Images showing railway track falls, cracks, or obstacles
* **Non-Defective** – Images showing normal railway track conditions

Images are preprocessed using resizing, normalization, and data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness and detection accuracy under different environmental conditions.

## ⚙️ Proposed Methodology

The system follows the steps below:

1. **Image Acquisition**
   Railway track images are captured using cameras or inspection devices.

2. **Preprocessing**
   Images are resized, normalized, and enhanced to improve visibility of defects.

3. **Region Proposal Generation**
   R-CNN generates region proposals that may contain defects.

4. **Feature Extraction**
   CNN layers extract meaningful features such as cracks, gaps, and track misalignment.

5. **Classification & Localization**
   Regions are classified as **Defective** or **Non-Defective**, and bounding boxes are drawn around detected defects.

6. **Alert Generation**
   When a defective track is detected, the system generates an **alert message and siren sound** to warn railway authorities.

## 🔔 Alert & Safety Notification System

A major highlight of this project is the **alert mechanism**.

When a railway track defect is detected:

* A **siren alarm is triggered**
* A **warning message is displayed on screen**
* The defective region is clearly highlighted
* Immediate preventive action can be taken

This alert-based response helps prevent accidents and enhances real-time safety awareness.

## 🌐 Web Application

A Flask-based web application is developed to provide an interactive interface for railway track monitoring. The application allows users to:

* Upload railway track images
* Perform real-time defect detection
* View detection results with bounding boxes
* Receive **instant alert messages and siren warnings**

## 🧪 Testing & Results

The system was tested using multiple railway track images.

### Observations:

* Accurate detection of **track falls, cracks, and obstacles**
* Clear visualization of defects using bounding boxes
* Immediate alert generation for defective tracks
